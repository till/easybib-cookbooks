# Cookbooks!

All these cookbooks are [BSD Licensed][bsd], so feel free to use and abuse.

[bsd]: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php

Please not that some recipes rely on a scalarium setup/environment so you best test the setup before you call it a day. Some are also heavy work in progress. Take into account that even though they are used in production all/most of them are still `0.1` versioned.

Questions, comments? Feel free to [get in touch][touch]!
