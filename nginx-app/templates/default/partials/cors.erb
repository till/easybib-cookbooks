        #
        # Comment on some particular headers below:
        #
        # Authorization -- practically and officially needed to support
        # requests using HTTP Basic Access authentication. Browser JS
        # can use HTTP BA authentication with an XmlHttpRequest object
        # req by calling
        #
        #   req.withCredentials=true,  and
        #   req.setRequestHeader('Authorization','Basic ' + window.btoa(theusername + ':' + thepassword))
        #
        # Counterintuitively, the username and password fields on
        # XmlHttpRequest#open cannot be used to set the authorization
        # field automatically for CORS requests.
        #
        # Content-Type -- this is a "simple header" only when it's
        # value is either application/x-www-form-urlencoded,
        # multipart/form-data, or text/plain; and in that case it does
        # not officially need to be included. But, if your browser
        # code sets the content type as application/json, for example,
        # then that makes the header non-simple, and then your server
        # must declare that it allows the Content-Type header.
        #
        # Accept,Accept-Language,Content-Language -- these are the
        # "simple headers" and they are officially never
        # required. Practically, possibly required.
        #
        # Origin -- logically, should not need to be explicitly
        # required, since it's implicitly required by all of
        # CORS. officially, it is unclear if it is required or
        # forbidden! practically, probably required by existing
        # browsers (Gecko does not request it but WebKit does, so
        # WebKit might choke if it's not returned back).
        #
        # User-Agent,DNT -- officially, should not be required, as
        # they cannot be set as "author request headers". practically,
        # may be required.
        #
        # My Comment:
        #
        # The specs are contradictory, or else just confusing to me,
        # in how they describe certain headers as required by CORS but
        # forbidden by XmlHttpRequest. The CORS spec says the browser
        # is supposed to set Access-Control-Request-Headers to include
        # only "author request headers" (section 7.1.5). And then the
        # server is supposed to use Access-Control-Allow-Headers to
        # echo back the subset of those which is allowed, telling the
        # browser that it should not continue and perform the actual
        # request if it includes additional headers (section 7.1.5,
        # step 8). So this implies the browser client code must take
        # care to include all necessary headers as author request
        # headers.
        #
        # However, the spec for XmlHttpRequest#setRequestHeader
        # (section 4.6.2) provides a long list of headers which the
        # the browser client code is forbidden to set, including for
        # instance Origin, DNT (do not track), User-Agent, etc.. This
        # is understandable: these are all headers that we want the
        # browser itself to control, so that malicious browser client
        # code cannot spoof them and for instance pretend to be from a
        # different origin, etc..
        #
        # But if XmlHttpRequest forbids the browser client code from
        # setting these (as per the XmlHttpRequest spec), then they
        # are not author request headers. And if they are not author
        # request headers, then the browser should not include them in
        # the preflight request's Access-Control-Request-Headers. And
        # if they are not included in Access-Control-Request-Headers,
        # then they should not be echoed by
        # Access-Control-Allow-Headers. And if they are not echoed by
        # Access-Control-Allow-Headers, then the browser should not
        # continue and execute actual request. So this seems to imply
        # that the CORS and XmlHttpRequest specs forbid certain
        # widely-used fields in CORS requests, including the Origin
        # field, which they also require for CORS requests.
        #
        # The bottom line: it seems there are headers needed for the
        # web and CORS to work, which at the moment you should
        # hard-code into Access-Control-Allow-Headers, although
        # official specs imply this should not be necessary.
